  ## Key Concepts Learned
- The goal of public policy analytics, as opposed to the private sector, is not necessarily optimization. There are tradeoffs and context that need to be considered
- Git Vs. Github
- Git: Version control system to track changes, can be used as a collab tool
- GitHub: Cloud hosting for git repo; back-up/share/deploy
- Flow: 
  - Edit files in RStudio
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- Push to GitHub
- Portfolio updates automatically
- Covered GitHub, Quarto, and R/RStudio
- Repo: folder containing project files
- Commit: snapshot of work at a point in time
- Push: sending changes to GitHub cloud
- Pull: getting latest changes from GitHub cloud (onto local) 
- Tidyverse 
- Tibbles vs. Data Frames
- Tiddles is enhanced data frames
- shows first 10 rows by default
- displays column names
- fits nicely on a screen 

## Coding Techniques
- R Functions
- select; filter; mutate; summarize; group_by
- Quarto Functions
- How to create and edit a portfolio
- Text formatting (bold, italic, bold italic, code text, strikethrough, Main Header, Section Header, Subsection Header)

## Questions & Challenges
- What is the difference between data table and data frame? 
  - Generally, I need better file management on RStudio
- Still a little confused about tibbles; are those just better data frames? 
  - Double-check/review piping 

## Connections to Policy
- Using open-source tools will be helpful in public work because you avoid licensure/acquisition
- Possibilities for open-source in the future

## Reflection
- I really liked the walkthrough of R syntax
- I will continue to practice ! Excited to learn more
