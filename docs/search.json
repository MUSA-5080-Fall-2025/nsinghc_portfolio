There are tradeoffs and context that need to be considered - Git Vs. Github - Git: Version control system to track changes, can be used as a collab tool - GitHub: Cloud hosting for git repo; back-up/share/deploy - Flow: - Edit files in RStudio - Commit changes with descriptive messages - Push to GitHub - Portfolio updates automatically - Covered GitHub, Quarto, and R/RStudio - Repo: folder containing project files - Commit: snapshot of work at a point in time - Push: sending changes to GitHub cloud - Pull: getting latest changes from GitHub cloud (onto local) - Tidyverse - Tibbles vs. Data Frames - Tiddles is enhanced data frames - shows first 10 rows by default - displays column names - fits nicely on a screen"
